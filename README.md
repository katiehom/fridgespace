# FridgeSpace

Memories can live on - online - instead of on the fridge. </br>
Users can upload childrenâ€™s artwork, greeting cards and other photos to display in their gallery.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <strong>Cloudinary, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS, Passport.js, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI & MVC architecture.</strong>

FridgeSpace is a full stack web application utilizing MVC architecture. It runs on Node.js and Express for the backend and EJS to render the views. Users can sign up using passport authentication and begin uploading new images to their studio adding some information about the image within a form. The studio images are shared in a community gallery. Users can like images, or individual images can be deleted if desired.

## Optimizations
Future iterations may consider utilizing React.js for views, privatizing gallery images for protection, including the ability to add multiple studios to an account for more than one child, including a gallery code that can be shared with family and friends for access to the private gallery, the ability to make comments, and adding editing options for individual studio submissions.

## Lessons Learned:

As someone who loves CSS, it was a learning process using Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI, but an enjoyable and successful one in the end. I learned that there were times when I needed to use Tailwind classes in tandem with Daisy UI, but I did not need to use additional custom CSS to complete my design. While EJS is straightforward in its implementation, I still ran into instances where I found it limiting.
